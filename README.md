# C Program: Buffer Overflow Example
This C program demonstrates a buffer overflow vulnerability (out-of-bounds write) by writing data beyond the limits of a statically allocated buffer. It aims to explain how these types of vulnerabilities can occur and the potential dangers they pose, such as data corruption and security exploits.



## Description
This C program highlights the risk of out-of-bounds writes by showing a buffer overflow scenario. It demonstrates what happens when more data is written to a buffer than it can hold. This kind of vulnerability can lead to unpredictable program behavior, crashes, or security risks such as arbitrary code execution.
